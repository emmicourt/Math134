PERHAPS I COULD BEST DESCRIBE MY EXPERIENCE OF DOING MATHEMATICS IN TERMS OF ENTERING A DARK MANSION. YOU GO INTO THE FIRST ROOM AND IT IS DARK, COMPLETELY DARK. YOU STUMBLE AROUND, BUMPING INTO THE FURNITURE. GRADUALLY, YOU LEARN WHERE EACH PIECE OF FURNITURE IS. AND FINALLY, AFTER SIX MONTHS OR SO, YOU FIND THE LIGHT SWITCH AND TURN IT ON. SUDDENLY, IT IS ALL ILLUMINATED AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE. THEN YOU ENTER THE NEXT DARK ROOM... ANDREW WILES
